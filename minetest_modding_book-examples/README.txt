Examples for Minetest Modding Book
==================================

Some of the chapter folders are modpacks. As the mod configurator (eg: configure
on world select) doesn't support modpacks in modpacks, you need to take out all
of these folders and install them into the mod location.
For example, minetest/mods/1_folders and minetest/mods/3_nodes_items_crafting
