### Hotfix Release

##### Prepare release branch

When hotfixing, you should never release new features. Any new code increases risk of new bugs which has additional testing/release concerns. 
To mitigate this, you just release the last release, and the relevant bug fix. For this, we do the following:

* Create release branch from the last release tag, push it:

git checkout -b release/0.82.1 0.82.0

git push origin release/0.82.1

##### Prepare feature branch and fix

* Create feature branch from that release branch (can review it to check only fix is there, nothing else, and use to also merge into master separately)

git checkout -b hotfix_bug_1_branch

* Fix crash/serious bug and commit
* Push branch and create pr to the release and also the master branch (Do not rebase, to reduce merge conflict risk. Do not delete after first merge or it needs to be repushed)

##### Update version and tag the release

* After all fixes are in release branch, pull it locally  (best to avoid a merge conflict as feature branch will need to be merged into master also, which already changed version):

* Update version in game.conf to hotfix version and commit it. Example: version=0.82.1

* Tag it, push tag and branch:

git tag 0.82.1

git push origin 0.82.1

git push origin release/0.82.1

Note: If you have to do more than 1 hotfix release, can do it on the same release branch.
