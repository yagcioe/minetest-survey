## X-Decor-libre [`xdecor`] ##

This is a libre version (free software, free media) of the X-Decor mod for Minetest.
It is the same as X-Decor, except with all the non-free files replaced.

### Background

X-Decor is a popular mod in Minetest but it is (as the time of writing this text)
non-free software, there are various files under proprietary licenses.

The purpose of this repository is to provide the community a fully-free fork of
X-Decor with clearly documented licenses.

No other changes (e.g. bugfixes, features, etc.) will be made in X-Decor-libre.

### List of replaced files

This is the list of non-free files in the original X-Decor mod
(as of commit 8b614b3513f2719d5975c883180c011cb7428c8d)

### Technical information
X-Decor-libre is a fork of X-Decor, from <https://github.com/minetest-mods/xdecor>,
